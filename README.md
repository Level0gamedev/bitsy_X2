# bitsy_HD
a ~tiny~ slightly bigger text-based fantasy console

Bitsy X2 is a hack of [Bitsy by Adam le Doux](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) that changes the sprite size from 8x8 to 16x16 pixels. 

Big thanks to [synth_ruiner](https://github.com/synth-ruiner) for updating Bitsy HD to Bitsy 6.x

You can use it in your browser on [itch](https://vonbednar.itch.io/bitsy-x2)
